	<h2>Cashmere Vs OBHS</h2>
			<p>
				Our Senior A team played Cashmere Senior As today as part of Cashmere's South Island tour. It was an early start for Cashmere as they travelled from Oamaru at 6:30am this morning so that the Snr A team could get a game in against JMC before playing our Senior As at 12:30pm. Despite the quick turnaround, and having played three games in as many days, Cashmere still had some gas in the tank and drew the first quarter 22-all. OBHS took a 6-point lead going into the half time break (53-47), but the second half was a struggle for Cashmere as their earlier game started to catch up with them. They managed just 26 points in the second half, and OBHS went on to win 98-73 (M Ruske 51pts, J Reeves 20 pts, M Pyper 11 pts).

	<h2>More OBHS vs Cashmere</h2>
			<p>
				The Junior A's won their game against Cashmere Junior A's 97-60. They played well together as a team and put up a solid performance at both ends of the court.
			<br>
			<br>
				The Senior B team, hampered by injuries and foul trouble, were unable to compete with the Cashmere Senior B team and went down by 18 points.
			<br>

	<h2>South Island Qualifiers</h2>
			<p>
				OBHS have qualified for Secondary School Nationals with a win over Waitaki Boys 91-77. An injury to Angus Henderson at the start of the match saw him watch the final from the sideline. Despite losing one of their starters, OBHS were able to hold off a strong first half performance by WBHS, going into the half-time break with a slim 2-point lead (39-37). Otago Boys had a strong third quarter, outscoring Waitaki Boys by 33-13, and giving them a 22-point buffer heading into the fourth. Lapses in defence and an increase in turnovers gave WBHS a chance to get back into the game with 5 minutes to go in the fourth. However, Michael Ruske and Matthew Pyper continued their strong performance and steadied the ship, helping OBHS to take the win by 14 points. Top scorers were Michael Ruske - 35 pts (58% from the field), 4 assists, 5 steals; Matthew Pyper - 30 pts (including 6 from 9 three-pointers and an overall accuracy of 73% from the field), 3 steals; Josh Reeves, 13 pts; and Callum Cooper 9 pts.

				In the earlier game against Southland Boys, OBHS won 103-77. Each time OBHS looked like they where about to pull way from SBHS, Southland would find ways to score, reducing any lead OBHS had to below double figures. It wasn't until the 4th quarter that OBHS really started to exert their dominance outscoring SBHS 31-20. Top scorers were Michael Ruske - 34 pts, 4 assists and 7 steals; Matthew Pyper 17 pts; Josh Reeves 12 pts; Callum Cooper 11 pts; and Eric Pieta 10 pts, 11 rebounds and 3 steals).
